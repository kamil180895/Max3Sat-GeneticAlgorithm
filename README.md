# Max3Sat-GeneticAlgorithm-C-

It is genetic algorithm for solving max3sat problem. It was created for university competition.

During tests the minimum quality of the solution achieved by this algorithm was 99,5% for test data attached to this project. Single test run (single file) was 20 minutes long on Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8600K CPU @ 3.60GHz.
